# `envelope` - Verifiable Credential Example

In this example we build a permanent resident card, which the holder then redacts to reveal only selected information necessary to prove his identity.

Envelopes can also be built to support verifiable credentials, supporting the core functionality of DIDs.

John Smith's identifier:

ðŸ‘‰
```bash
JOHN_ARID=`envelope generate arid`
echo $JOHN_ARID
ur:arid/hdcxrowefshyrpbapewtbwjowpvlimztemamzevoktdwdytnvldloltadeihwewschlflutinbfm
```

A photo of John Smith:

ðŸ‘‰
```bash
JOHN_IMAGE=`envelope subject type string "John Smith Smiling" | \
envelope assertion add pred-obj known note string "This is an image of John Smith." | \
envelope assertion add pred-obj known dereferenceVia uri "https://exampleledger.com/digest/36be30726befb65ca13b136ae29d8081f64792c2702415eb60ad1c56ed33c999"`
envelope format $JOHN_IMAGE
```

ðŸ‘ˆ
```envelope
"John Smith Smiling" [
    'dereferenceVia': URI(https://exampleledger.com/digest/36be30726befb65ca13b136ae29d8081f64792c2702415eb60ad1c56ed33c999)
    'note': "This is an image of John Smith."
]
```

John wishes to identify himself to a third party using his government-issued credential, but does not wish to reveal more than his name, his photo, and the fact that the state has verified his identity.

Redaction is performed by building a set of digests that will be revealed. All digests not present in the reveal-set will be replaced with elision markers containing only the hash of what has been elided, thus preserving the hash tree including revealed signatures. If a higher-level object is elided, then everything it contains will also be elided, so if a deeper object is to be revealed, all of its parent objects also need to be revealed, even though not everything *about* the parent objects must be revealed.

ðŸ‘‰
```bash
# Start a target set.
TARGET=()

# Reveal the card. Without this, everything about the card would be elided.
TARGET+=(`envelope digest $JOHN_RESIDENT_CARD`)

# Reveal everything about the state's signature on the card
TARGET+=(`envelope assertion find predicate known signed $JOHN_RESIDENT_CARD | envelope digest --depth deep`)

# Reveal the top level of the card.
TARGET+=(`envelope digest $JOHN_RESIDENT_CARD --depth shallow`)
CARD=`envelope extract wrapped $JOHN_RESIDENT_CARD`
TARGET+=(`envelope digest $CARD`)
TARGET+=(`envelope extract envelope $CARD | envelope digest`)

# Reveal everything about the `isA` and `issuer` assertions at the top level of the card.
TARGET+=(`envelope assertion find predicate known isA $CARD | envelope digest --depth deep`)
TARGET+=(`envelope assertion find predicate known issuer $CARD | envelope digest --depth deep`)

# Reveal the `holder` assertion on the card, but not any of its sub-assertions.
HOLDER=`envelope assertion find predicate known holder $CARD`
TARGET+=(`envelope digest --depth shallow $HOLDER`)

# Within the `holder` assertion, reveal everything about just the `givenName`, `familyName`, and `image` assertions.
HOLDER_OBJECT=`envelope extract object $HOLDER`
TARGET+=(`envelope assertion find predicate string givenName $HOLDER_OBJECT | envelope digest --depth deep`)
TARGET+=(`envelope assertion find predicate string familyName $HOLDER_OBJECT | envelope digest --depth deep`)
TARGET+=(`envelope assertion find predicate string image $HOLDER_OBJECT | envelope digest --depth deep`)

# Perform the elision

Print the number of digests in the target set.

ðŸ‘‰
```bash
echo ${#TARGET[@]}
```

ðŸ‘ˆ
```
46
```

Remove duplicates to get the number of unique digests in the target. Duplicates don't harm anything, but they might point to opportunities for optimization.

ðŸ‘‰
```bash
UNIQUE_DIGESTS=( `for i in ${TARGET[@]}; do echo $i; done | sort -u` )
echo ${#UNIQUE_DIGESTS[@]}
```

ðŸ‘ˆ
```
40
```

Note that the original card and the elided card have the same digest.

ðŸ‘‰
```bash
envelope digest $JOHN_RESIDENT_CARD; envelope digest $ELIDED_CARD
```

ðŸ‘ˆ
```
ur:digest/hdcxstcnlogtmnuraesttbnngojeryeebswtqznsbbgdjnfemucwonhlbbhfrywyadlyhpcftkft
ur:digest/hdcxstcnlogtmnuraesttbnngojeryeebswtqznsbbgdjnfemucwonhlbbhfrywyadlyhpcftkft
```

Note that the state's signature on the elided card still verifies.

ðŸ‘‰
```bash
envelope verify --silent $ELIDED_CARD --pubkeys $STATE_PUBKEYS
```
